The CveXplore package aims to provide an object related way to interact with the data collected or hosted by a
cve-search instance. It provides an ambiguous way to interact with either the cve-search mongodb or the cve-search API.

From version 0.2.5 onwards CveXplore has the possibility to initialize and update the database without the need of any of
the cve-search binaries and thus providing the same functionality as cve-search but without the GUI components.

A click command line functionality is being build but for now still in progress...

All the data provided by this interaction is converted into objects before being returned. And thus providing a way to
interact with objects rather then with raw data.

Dependencies
------------
As stated you will need to have one of two things; in order to fully use this package you need access to:

* A cve-search mongodb instance

OR

* A cve-search API instance (will be retired in the 0.4 release)

Both of them can be easily created on a physical machine or via a docker instance of cve-search;
please check `cve-search <https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search>`_ or
`CVE-Search-Docker <https://github.com/cve-search/CVE-Search-Docker>`_ for further details.

Installation
------------
Package is hosted on pypi, so to install the minimal core just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install CveXplore

This command will install the core logic of CveXplore and, by default, installs the mongodb module also.

CveXplore is setup in a modular way and therefor has multiple modules which can be installed separately by specifying
them as an extra requirement. To install the mysql module only, specify:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install CveXplore[mysql]

Or for multiple modules:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install CveXplore[mysql, redis]

Or simple install all modules:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install CveXplore[all]

Documentation
-------------
Check `github pages documentation <https://cve-search.github.io/CveXplore/>`_

General
-------

Configuration
*************

CveXplore automatically creates a config folder in '~/.cvexplore'. CveXplore stores several configuration
files in here such as the .env for general configuration and the .sources.ini for data sources configuration.

Logging
*******

CveXplore stores all logs in the '~/.cvexplore/log' folder:

* update_populate.log; logging produced during database updates and database initialization.

Local Database populate / update
********************************

As of version 0.2.5 CveXplore can populate and update a local mongodb instance from either the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cvexplore database initialize
    $ cvexplore database update

Check the `CLI Documentation <https://cve-search.github.io/CveXplore/cli/cli.html>`_ for more information.

Or via the the CveXplore object:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from CveXplore import CveXplore
    >>> cvx = CveXplore()
    >>> cvx.database.populate()
    >>> cvx.database.update()

You can add your `nist api key <https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key>`_ in the .env file.
You can populate CveXplore without an api key, but it will limit the amount of parallel requests made to the NIST api.

Package usage
-------------

Instantiation
*************

CveXplore can be instantiated with different parameters, depending to which data source you're going to connect to.
If no parameters are given it is assumed that you're going to connect to a mongodb database running on localhost with
default port and security settings (Cve Search default parameters).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from CveXplore import CveXplore
    >>> cvx = CveXplore()
    >>> cvx.version
    '0.1.2'

To let CveXplore connect to an mongodb with specific parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from CveXplore import CveXplore
    >>> cvx = CveXplore(datasource_type="mongodb", datasource_connection_details={"host": "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"})
    >>> cvx.version
    '0.1.2'

And to let CveXplore talk to an Cve Search API (only query POST endpoint needed):

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from CveXplore import CveXplore
   >>> cvx = CveXplore(datasource_type="api", datasource_connection_details={"address": ("mylocal.cve-search.int", 443), "api_path": "api"})
   >>> cvx.version
   '0.1.2'

For More options please check the package documentation
